# pwa-nsb-monitor

A Progressive Web App for showing real time information for NSB train stations.
The app is written with React and uses Web Workers.

**Note**: [Bane NOR](https://www.banenor.no/) released a native Android [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.banenor.naa) which pretty much does what my PWA inteded to do: monitor specific train lines in specific stations and give notifications about delays and cancellations.
Development for this PWA won't continue, but it was/is a good exercise for trying out PWA and various web APIs.
The repo will stay here for future reference.
